In this experiment prepare the files necessary for Ira's rotation project. 

For Ira's Rotation project Hannes is interested in mapping the raw data in a DIA run OSW results. 


1. How much of the raw data is currently explained by the OSW features
2. Is the raw data "used twice" 
	- One raw data is mapped to multiple library entries 

Also look at this on the MS1 level. 


Here is Hannes' original message 


Dear Josh

Ira is a rotation student joining us for 5 weeks and in his project I
want to look at mapping the raw data in a DIA run to the OpenSWATH
results. Basically we want to answer the question of how much of the
raw data do we currently explain and secondary whether there is some
raw data that is "used twice", eg where the same raw data signal is
used multiple times in more than one assay

the last question to explore would be whether we can also map these
back to precursors from the MS1 map (eg found with maxquant oder a
similar tool) to state not just how much intensity we can explain but
also how many precursors.

I suggest that we provide Ira a single SWATH window for this of about
2-5 min length somewhere from the middle of the gradient so that he
can start to work on this. One of the more recent single shot DIA with
200 / 250 ng from the Gingras lab should do, probably the one where we
have the best coverage (100k precursors). He will also need the OSW
results to map them to the raw data.

------------------------
In this experiment 
1. Copy over the OSW results (.osw)
2. Create a 5 minute "SWATH" (300 seconds) in the middle of the window for Ira to analyze
	- This is about ~300 SWATHS
